This is a primitive example of how to package up code for a paper. It is so
primitive that it is just a bash script, seriously. that's primitive.

This is essentially what I packaged up as verification code for the [Why
Publishing Everything Is More Effective than Selective Publishing of
Statistically Significant
Results](http://labs.researchcompendia.org/compendia/2014.6/) labs page which
is based off of [this production example](http://researchcompendia.org/compendia/418/).

Additionally, the R code accompanying the paper would have taken quite a
long time to run. We changed the number of reps so that users can download
the code and run it in a few minutes. Look at commit [3658f6d1c3592b2e1dd50987d55b0209a4ea9d94](https://github.com/researchcompendia/labs-2014-6/commit/3658f6d1c3592b2e1dd50987d55b0209a4ea9d94) to see the demo diff.
