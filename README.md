This is a primitive example of how to package up code for a paper. It is so
primitive that it is just a bash script, seriously. that's primitive.

This is essentially what I packaged up as verification code for the [Why
Publishing Everything Is More Effective than Selective Publishing of
Statistically Significant
Results](http://labs.researchcompendia.org/compendia/2/) labs page which
is based off of [this production example](http://researchcompendia.org/compendia/418/).

Additionally, the R code accompanying the paper would have taken quite a
long time to run. We changed the number of reps so that users can download
the code and run it in a few minutes. Look at the diff to see the demo changes.
